# Latex settings

Here we provide additional files for generating latex files. This includes:

## Document classes and formats

- CMS Slides: Beamer style for slides that will be used for non-specific CMS group presentation
- `assignments.cls`: A nice set of A4 formats for assignments (or listed question with long responses in general)
- `tikzfigure.cls`: Generating a tikz figure into a single file, good for diagram generations to be used else where

## Symbols and formatting

- `mysymbols.sty`: set of symbols commonly used in the math expressions and
  physics expressions. 
- `lstlisting.sty`: default settings for nice looking code listing 
- `defaultfont.sty`: Setting up default fonts for documents with not specific
  font requirement. To use this setting the corresponding fonts will need to be installed
